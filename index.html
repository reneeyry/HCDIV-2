                <div class="comment">Example 1: Apple FY24 Income Statement Chart
Introduction to charts ：This chart is a visualization of Apple's FY24 income flow, using a Sankey diagram to display revenue, costs, and net profit across various product lines. On the left, the chart shows major product lines: iPhone, MacBook, iPad, Watch and AirPods, as well as Services. Each product line's revenue is represented by gray flows that merge into the total revenue. The middle section displays Apple’s overall revenue and costs, where revenue flows into gross profit and then further into operating profit. Finally, on the right, the chart presents Apple’s net profit, including details on taxes, R&D, and SG&A expenses. The width and color of each flow represent the relationships between revenue and expenses, with annotations showing year-over-year percentage changes (e.g., growth or decrease).
1. Data and presentation issues
A:Data completeness and accuracy: This chart shows the revenue sources and cost distribution of multiple product lines. The data is complete, but due to the large number of product lines, it may appear to be overloaded visually.
B:Presentation: The chart uses a Sankey Diagram, which is suitable for expressing data flow. However, the distribution of revenue and cost is too dense, and the use of colors (red, green, and gray) attempts to distinguish revenue and cost, but makes the chart appear crowded, affecting the clarity of information communication.
2. Improvement suggestions
Simplify and separate information: It is recommended to display the revenue and cost of different product lines separately, or use a bar chart to show the revenue contribution of each product, which can more intuitively understand the proportion of each part.
Reduce the use of colors: Appropriately reduce the color or adjust the contrast to highlight key data, such as the difference between revenue and cost, to avoid visual overcrowding and confusion.
